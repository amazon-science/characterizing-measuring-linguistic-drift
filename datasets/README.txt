Our pre-compiled datasets can be downloaded and placed in this directory.
Then, all scripts can be run for our datasets, by setting the task flag to "sentiment_amazon_categories", "sentiment_amazon_years", or "mnli", and by setting the dataset_dir flag to "datasets".
The custom settings (nlp_drift/custom_settings.py) only need to be updated if you are using your own dataset.
